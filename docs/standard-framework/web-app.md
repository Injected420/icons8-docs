 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/text_tool_edit_1.png'>
 </p>
 Recolor, overlay and text are the effects applied to the icon with the use of toggle button. You may combine the effects by setting the appropriate buttons. The rest of the effects (stroke, padding, background, circle, square) are applied with the use of the radio button. You may apply one of the effect at a time or select the <b>"No Effects"</b> state when neither of the effects mentioned are applied.
 
 <br>
 The <b> stroke effect</b>  enhances the prominent features of the icon with the specified size/weight. You may change the color of the stroke either.
 
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/stroke_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>

 </p>
 
 <br>

 <b> Circle effect</b>  has various parameters which make this feature to be a very flexible tool. You may specify stroke, icon and circle sizes. 
 
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/circle_effect_edit_with_circle.png'>

       <strong> Collections </strong>
     </summary>
     
  <br>
Collections is the best way to orgonize the icons you like into certain groups for further applications. You may create multiple collections with the 1000 icons limit per collection. Icons can be added into a collection just by dragging and dropping it or just by pressing on a special label in the upper right corner of the outer space surrounding each icon when mouse cursor is over the icon. This is demonstrated on the screenshot below. Notice that red labels indicate that current icon is already added into your collection. 
  
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/add_icons_to_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
You may drag and drop an <b>svg</b> icon from web app or from your local file system right into the collection. Please note that only files in SVG format can be added to your collection.

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/collections_drag_and_drop.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
In addidtion to drag and drop feature you may add new icons to collection by pressing <b>add sign</b> within your collection. This will launch file manager which will guide you through the procedure of selecting an svg file from your local file system and adding it to the collection: 
 
  <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/Collection_FileManager_2.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
 To delete an icon from collection just hover the mouse cursor over the icon and click on the trash sign that will come up. A dialog will further ask you to confirm and proceed with the deletion. 
 
 
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_item_from_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
  
You may delete the entire collection just by hovering the mouse cursor over the collection in the list of collections and clicking on the trash can icon:

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_entire_collection_with_trash_can.png'>
 </p>

  <br>
Another way to delete the entire collection or change its title is to click on the more options icon while you are within a given collection. A menu with two options will show up: <b>edit title</b> of the collection and <b>delete</b> the entire collection:

   <p align="center">
