      section-description: <a href="https://icons8.com/app">Desktop apps</a> are the native applications for Windows and Mac.</p> 
      <p>The main idea behind the desktop apps is to provide offline access to our icons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download it once and use it offline side by side with design tools of your choice.<li> 
        <li>Search is instant (you get your search results updated on each key press, so you get the <a href="https://icons8.com/icons/set/facebook">Facebook icons</a> immediately after pressing "f".<li>
        <li>Drag and drop icons from the app right into your design software, such as <a href="https://sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> or <a href="https://icons8.com/lunacy">Lunacy</a>.<li>
       </ul> 
       <p>It is that simple and effective! Take your dev process to the next level with our desktop apps!
